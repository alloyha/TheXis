TheXis
=======

LaTeX class for textual documents at Polytechnic School of USP.

TheXis (pronounce: `tɛʧiz`) follows the ABNT thesis class adapted from: 

1. Prof. Paulo Barreto: on at-the-time standards, available on [link](https://www.ime.usp.br/~leofl/tex/));
2. Luiz Chamon: on 2013-standards, available on [link](https://github.com/lfochamon/poliTeX)). 

The current class presents considerable changes on class implementation and features. 

Remarkable changes are:

+ Unsupported non-based POLI-USP standards fixes: functions, headers, titles, table of contents, among others;
+ Code refactor: added comments to allow maintainability. The new class has half the previous class size;
+ Bad practices removal: undesirable ```fancyhdr``` e ```geometry```;
+ Pre-textual implementation changes;
+ New features: 
    - pre-textual and under chapter titles epigraph;
    - `\part`;
    - multiple authors;
    - Bachelor thesis;
+ Internacionalization: supports `english`. "Other languages" is the next step ;
