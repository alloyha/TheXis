TheXis
=======

LaTeX class for textual documents at Polytechnic School of USP.

TheXis (pronounce: `tɛʧiz`) follows the ABNT thesis class adapted by Prof. Paulo Barreto on POLI-USP standards ([link](http://www.ime.usp.br/~leofl/tex/modelo_poli.zip)). The current class presents considerable changes on class implementation and features. 

Remarkable changes are:

+ Unsupported non-based POLI-USP standards funcions removal: headers, titles, table of contents, among others;
+ Code refactoring: added comments to allow maintainability. The new class has half the previous class size;
+ "Hacks" removal: ```fancyhdr``` e ```geometry``` are undesirable;
+ Pre-textual implementation changes;
+ New features: 
    - pre-textual and under chapter titles epígraph;
    - `\part` support;
    - multiple authors;
    - Bachelor thesis support;
+ Internacionalization: supports `english`. The next step is the other languages;
